# CaveTest31
Yet another test for me making an engine for Cave Story style games, using my own code.

# My Goal:
Make an actual engine I can use for fangames, including:

- Accuracy to the original game (movement wise)
- TSC-like events and shit
- Ease of use

# how much ya wanna bet ill never finish it

lol

# Other ideas.
- Full remake of the original cave story?! Lol? :)
